# ProgrammingStudyApp :books:
This is an application that was created during my Summer 2020 Intro to Programming class. An application that enables to take a short quiz on programming terms and tries to receive points.

# Assignment Challenge(s)
The biggest challenge that I face when building this application was the random method code since I didn't know how to formate that, but with my professor's help, I ended up figuring it out. I also had some difficulties with inserting codes to allow players to receive points and formate my questions and answer using an array or list. However, I figure that out with the help with my professor and the internship.
